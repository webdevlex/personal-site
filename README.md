## **Personl Website**

Welcome to my personal website! This site was built entirely from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've used a variety of CSS effects throughout the site to make it both visually engaging and user-friendly. From the planets rotation to the movment of the project section, I've employed a range of techniques to create a unique and dynamic experience for visitors. Whether you're here to learn more about me and my work, or just to explore the site's design, I hope you enjoy your visit!
